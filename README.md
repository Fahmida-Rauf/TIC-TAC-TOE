## TIC TAC TOE

Tic Tac Toe is a simple implementation of the classic Tic Tac Toe game in Java. It allows two players to play the game on the console.

## Gameplay

1. Players take turns to make a move by entering the row and column numbers where they want to place their symbol ('X' or 'O').
2. The game checks for a winner after each move.
3. The game ends when one player wins, or if the board is full and there is no winner (tie).
